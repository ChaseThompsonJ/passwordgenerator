# Challenge 3
Password Generator

## Description
For this challenge we were tasked to create a Password Generator.
My ideology on this was to start with a simple function and make
local scope variables inside of said function. I then began to make
the prompt with another function and start writing if statments for my prompts. The final start consisted of a for loop with some math to generate the password onto the webpage.

## Tasks Assigned 
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Technologies Used
